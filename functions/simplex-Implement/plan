Steps:
  - have two shapes
  - find center of 2 shapes
  - to create simplex
  --- use center of first shape and find the furthest point from first shape (pf1)
  --- next find furthest point in the OPOSITE direction in the second shape (pf2)
  --- subtract the first point and the second point to get the first support point (which is going to be first point of future triangle or line case)
  --- now get second point (below) also run loop
