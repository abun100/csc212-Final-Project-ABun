Start:

  - have two shapes
  - find center of 2 shapes
  
Create simplex:

  - to get direction of first point, find the vector between the two centers of the shapes
   i.e (d = normalize(s2.center - s1.center))
  
  - find the first point on the simplex
  
  - find the furthest point in the direction found before for the first shape
  (pf1)
  
  - now do the same with the second shape but in the opposite direction on the second shape 
  (pf2)
  
  - subtract the 2 points to get the first support point of simplex
  (pf1 - pf2) = A
  
  - to find second support point, the new direction will be facing the origin
  
  - repeat code from lines 12-19 for SECOND support point
  (although instead of A second point is now B)
  
  - KEY NOTE check if second point does not pass the origin from the perspective of A looking at origin
  
  - glimpse of main loop
  // d is direction
  while True:
    A = support(pf1, pf2, d0
