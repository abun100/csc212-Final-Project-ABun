Steps:
  - have two shapes
  - find center of 2 shapes
  - to create simplex
  --- to get direction of first point, find the vector between the two centers of the shapes
  (i.e d= normalize(s2.center - s1.center))
  
  --- find the first point on the simplex
  --- find the furthest point in the direction found before for the first shape
  (pf1)
  
  --- now do the same with the second shape but in the opposite direction on the second shape 
  (pf2)
  
  --- subtract the 2 points to get the first support point of simplex
  (pf1 - pf2)
  
  --- subtract the first point and the second point to get the first support point (which is going to be first point of future triangle or line case)
  
  --- now get second point (below) also run loop
